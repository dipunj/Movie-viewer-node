# Team **Angry Shadows**



We as college students accumulate huge piles of multimedia data, be it lectures, movies or TV shows and many other formats of media. So we decided to make a better file handler for such content.

Usually the default file manager (eg. nautilus on gnome) would do the job, but they really fail to make it look beautiful and manageable.
With this project we aim to make a file server in node.js express.js and probably with the help of electron. 

The TODO list is long for us : 

1. Develop the backend in nodejs, extract the well known file types.
2. Develop the frontend with help of angular.js and express.js and connect with backend.
3. After gaining this minimal functionality, our aim would be to make it smart, i.e fetch meta-data from imdb and display it beautifully on the front-end along with option to download subtitle for the media file, categorize the movies, provide a search facility based on the tags a movie has, for music lyrics can be shown along with album art and other meta-data.
4. Provide a permanently organise-the-data option, i.e actual change on the hard disk.
5. After learning how to use electron, we would like to develop the same as a electron app.
